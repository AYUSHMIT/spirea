(* We call it [hvec] just to distinguish is from the stdpp's [hlist]. We
parameterize [hvec] by a type [A] and a family [F] over the type. The key
benefit of this is that we then know that the elements in the elements in [hvec]
all have the shape [F x] for some [x : A].

For instance, [A] might be [Type] [F] might be [Î» x, x * x]. We would then know
that all elements in the list are pair. Furthermore, Coq is able to compute this
fact in some circumstantes. In particular [hvec_lookup] we can a priori know the
shape of the returned type without knowing the specific index and Coq can
compute with this fact.  *)
